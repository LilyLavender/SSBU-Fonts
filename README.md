# SSBU-Fonts
> A dump of all of Smash Ultimate's fonts in .otf format.  

Acessible on [GitHub Pages](https://lilylavender.github.io/SSBU-Fonts/). On the site you can download the fonts or copy the CSS required to use them in your projects. Since the fonts are hosted via GitHub Pages, they'll be usable anywhere without any CORS policy shenanigans.

If anyone would like a site like this for other themed fonts, feel free to reach out to me on Discord @LilyLambda or through email lilylambda@gmail.com to discuss :)
